# Getting started on smartlab-initiative-viewconf

This repository holds the content code for the front-end of the [Smartlab Initiative](https://smartlabbr.org). We invite all the community to join us in our mission and contribute. Since it's a resource repo, that just describes content, please refer to the [front-end project wiki](https://github.com/smartlab-br/smartlab-initiative/wiki) to understand the whole context and start contributing.

# How to translate a yaml file

The content code is organized by language. In the project's root, we can see a directory that refers to the language (```br```, for instance). In order to translate, you must access (or create by copying ```br```) the target language's directory and navigate through the files, changing the textual content. DO NOT CHANGE FILES' NAMES!!

Follow [these tips](https://github.com/smartlab-br/smartlab-initiative-viewconf/wiki/How-to-find-textual-contents-in-a-yaml-file) to efficiently detect contents in a yaml file.

As a good practice, create an issue for a new language translation (or send us an e-mail - smartlab-dev@mpt.mp.br) and we create it for you). If the issue is already in place, engage the community by discussing the topic and, therefore, collaborate more effectively.
